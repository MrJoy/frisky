## Description

Originally forked from [playful](https://github.com/turboladen/playful), this gem reduces the scope to just being an SSDP _client_, reducing dependencies considerably and making it easier to declare this stable and ready to use.

If you have a device that implements UPnP, you can most likely discover it programmatically with `frisky`.


### SSDP Searches

An SSDP search simply sends the `M-SEARCH` command out to the multicast group and listens for responses for a given (or default of 5 seconds) amount of time. The return from this depends on if you're running it within an EventMachine reactor or not. If not, it returns an Array of responses as Hashes, where keys are the header names, values are the header values.  Take a look at the `SSDP.search` docs for more on the options here.

```ruby
require 'frisky/ssdp'

# Search for all devices (do an M-SEARCH with the ST header set to 'ssdp:all')
all_devices = Frisky::SSDP.search                         # this is default
all_devices = Frisky::SSDP.search 'ssdp:all'              # or be explicit
all_devices = Frisky::SSDP.search :all                    # or use short-hand

# Search for root devices (do an M-SEARCH with ST header set to 'upnp:rootdevices')
root_devices = Frisky::SSDP.search 'upnp:rootdevices'
root_devices = Frisky::SSDP.search :root                  # or use short-hand

# Search for a device with a specific UUID
my_device = Frisky::SSDP.search 'uuid:3c202906-992d-3f0f-b94c-90e1902a136d'

# Search for devices of a specific type
my_media_server = Frisky::SSDP.search 'urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:MediaServer:1'

# All of these searches will return something that looks like
# => [
#      {
#         :control => "max-age=1200",
#         :date => "Sun, 23 Sep 2012 20:31:48 GMT",
#         :location => "http://192.168.10.3:5001/description/fetch",
#         :server => "Linux-i386-2.6.38-15-generic-pae, UPnP/1.0, PMS/1.50.0",
#         :st => "upnp:rootdevice",
#         :ext => "",
#         :usn => "uuid:3c202906-992d-3f0f-b94c-90e1902a136d::upnp:rootdevice",
#         :length => "0"
#       }
#     ]
```

If you do the search inside of an `EventMachine` reactor, as the `Frisky::SSDP::Searcher` receives and parses responses, it adds them to the accessor `#discovery_responses`, which is an `EventMachine::Channel`.  This lets you subscribe to the responses and do what you want with them as you receive them.

```ruby
require 'frisky/ssdp'

EM.run do
  searcher = Frisky::SSDP.search 'uuid:3c202906-992d-3f0f-b94c-90e1902a136d'

  # Create a deferrable object that can be notified when the device we want
  # has been found and created.
  device_controller = EventMachine::DefaultDeferrable.new

  # This callback will get called when the device_creator callback is called
  # (which is called after the device has been created).
  device_controller.callback do |device|
    p device.service_list.first.service_type          # "urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:ContentDirectory:1"

    # SOAP actions are converted to Ruby methods--show those
    p device.service_list.first.singleton_methods     # [:GetSystemUpdateID, :Search, :GetSearchCapabilities, :GetSortCapabilities, :Browse]

    # Call a SOAP method defined in the service.  The response is extracted from the
    # XML SOAP response and the value is converted from the UPnP dataType to
    # the related Ruby type.  Reponses are always contained in a Hash, so as
    # to maintain the relation defined in the service.
    p device.service_list.first.GetSystemUpdateID     # { :Id => 1 }
  end

  # Note that you don't have to check for items in the Channel or for when the
  # Channel is empty: EventMachine will pop objects off the Channel as soon as
  # they're put there and stop when there are none left.
  searcher.discovery_responses.pop do |notification|
    # Do stuff here.
  end
end
```
